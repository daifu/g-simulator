How to run the test:
1. Install nose using setuptools/distribute:

```Shell
easy_install nose
```
```Shell
pip install nose
```
Or, if you donâ€™t have setuptools/distribute installed, use the download link at right to download(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/) the source package, and install it in the normal fashion: Ungzip and untar the source package, cd to the new directory, and:
```Shell
python setup.py install
```

2. Run the test:
Go to the main directory, which is under g-simulator/
```Shell
nosetests
```

3. Naming convention for test files: please make sure all the file names are [class_name]_tests.py, or the test will fail.

4. Import libraries for testing
for example, testing the message.py:
```Python
from nose.tools import *
from pygnutella.message import Message
```
