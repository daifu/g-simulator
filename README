How to run the test:
====================

1. Install nose using setuptools/distribute:

> easy_install nose
OR
> pip install nose

Or, if you donâ€™t have setuptools/distribute installed, use the download link at right to download(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/) the source package, and install it in the normal fashion: Ungzip and untar the source package, cd to the new directory, and:
> python setup.py install

2. Run the test:
Go to the main directory, which is under g-simulator/
> nosetests

3. Naming convention for test files: please make sure all the file names are [class_name]_tests.py, or the test will fail.

4. Import libraries for testing
for example, we want to test message.py file:
> from nose.tools import *
> from pygnutella.message import Message
