Demo
=======================

First start up bootstrap node
> python run_bootstrap.py
OR
> python run_bootstrap.py SimpleBootstrap
OR
> python run_bootstrap.py RandomBootstrap <probability from 0 to 1>
OR
> python run_bootstrap.py DagBootstrap <an adjacent list string>

Second run servent nodes to build the network. 
> python run_servent.py <bootstrap_ip> <bootstrap_port> <num of node>

Help commands
=======================

Help commands on different bootstraping:
> python run_bootstrap.py help
OR
> python run_bootstrap.py help SimpleBootstrap
OR
> python run_bootstrap.py help RandomBootstrap
OR
> python run_bootstrap.py help DagBootstrap

Check required packages
=======================

Go to the current directory(under g-simulator), and run:
> python setup.py

It will check all the required packages and install nose if your system does
not have.

Run all the tests.
> nosetests

Coding Standard
=======================

+ indentation is 4 spaces not 2 spaces (and also not a tab). Configure your
editor to do so.
+ your class is in directory pygnutella (aka package pygnutella)
+ test script is in directory tests
+ class name: class name capitalise every word
+ method name and variable name: lower case and underscore between every word
+ use one logger from Servent
     
+ use doc string three quote """ """ for every class or function you feel the
name is too ambiguous
+ use # for comment

How to run the test
=======================

1. Install nose using setuptools/distribute:

> easy_install nose
OR
> pip install nose

Or, if you donâ€™t have setuptools/distribute installed, cd to the source
package(nose-1.1.2), and:
> python setup.py install
OR
> sudo python setup.py install

2. Run the test:
Go to the main directory, which is under g-simulator/
> nosetests

3. Naming convention for test files: please make sure all the file names are
[class_name]_tests.py, or the test will fail.

4. Import libraries for testing
for example, we want to test message.py file:
> from nose.tools import *
> from pygnutella.message import Message
