Coding Standard
====================

+ indentation is 4 spaces not 2 spaces (and also not a tab). Configure your editor to do so.
+ your class is in directory pygnutella (aka package pygnutella)
+ test script is in directory tests
+ class name: class name capitalise every word
+ method name and variable name: lower case and underscore between every word
+ make self.logger in every class as followed:

	import logging
    .....
    # define variable      
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__ +" "+ str(id(self)))
    .....
    # usage just like printf
    self.logger.debug('function() -> %s", variable)
     
+ use doc string three quote """ """ for every class or function you feel the name is too ambiguous
+ use # for comment

How to run the test
====================

1. Install nose using setuptools/distribute:

> easy_install nose
OR
> pip install nose

Or, if you donâ€™t have setuptools/distribute installed, use the download link at right to download(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/) the source package, and install it in the normal fashion: Ungzip and untar the source package, cd to the new directory, and:
> python setup.py install

2. Run the test:
Go to the main directory, which is under g-simulator/
> nosetests

3. Naming convention for test files: please make sure all the file names are [class_name]_tests.py, or the test will fail.

4. Import libraries for testing
for example, we want to test message.py file:
> from nose.tools import *
> from pygnutella.message import Message
